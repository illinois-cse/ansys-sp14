{"name":"ANSYS","tagline":"","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\nANSYS is a popular engineering design and simulation platform centered around finite-element analysis (FEA).  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to FEA, nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 471 which introduce FEA concepts.  This course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which engineering students and researchers may encounter in FEA.\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\nWe will use the [Etherpad](http://meetingwords.com/ehlagqUook) to share complicated snippets of code and text during class.  The Post-It notes are to indicate either your completion of a task (green) or your need of assistance (pink).\r\n\r\n## First Section (17–18 February)\r\n\r\n## Second Section (19–20 February)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
