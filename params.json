{"name":"ANSYS","tagline":"","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\nANSYS is a popular engineering design and simulation platform centered around finite-element analysis (FEA).  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to FEA, nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 471 which introduce FEA concepts.  This course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which engineering students and researchers may encounter in FEA.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n[Feedback survey](https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/9074117)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
